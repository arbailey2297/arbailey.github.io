# üñºÔ∏è Curation

Below are photographs from a recent exhibition I curated at <b>PAVED Arts</b> in Saskatoon in Summer 2023 titled <b><i>Object Gardens</i></b>. Participating artists included Guggenheim fellow <b>Peter Burr</b> (USA), 2018 EQ Bank Emerging Digital Artist Award winner <b>Anna Eyler</b> (CAD), and Venice Biennale-presenting artist <b>Jakob Kudsk Steensen</b> (DNK).<br/>

Below is a photograph of a recent exhibition I coordinated and produced at the <b>Archives of Ontario</b> in Summer 2023 titled <b><i>Margaret Perry: A Life in Film</i></b>. The traveling exhibition was originally put on at the Nova Scotia Archives and curated by <b>Jennifer VanerBurgh</b> (St. Mary's University) and <b>Carla Taunton</b> (NSCAD), and I worked with them to recreate it at the Archives of Ontario as a part of that year's Congress of the Social Sciences and Humanities at York University.
