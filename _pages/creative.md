# üñºÔ∏è Curation

Below are photographs from a recent exhibition I curated at <b>PAVED Arts</b> in Saskatoon in Summer 2023 titled <b><i>Object Gardens</i></b>. Participating artists included Guggenheim fellow <b>Peter Burr</b> (USA), 2018 EQ Bank Emerging Digital Artist Award winner <b>Anna Eyler</b> and her partner and collaborator Nicolas Lapointe (CAD), and Venice Biennale-presenting artist <b>Jakob Kudsk Steensen</b> (DNK).<br/>

Below is a photograph of a recent exhibition I coordinated and produced at the <b>Archives of Ontario</b> in Summer 2023 titled <b><i>Margaret Perry: A Life in Film</i></b>. The traveling exhibition was originally put on at the <b>Nova Scotia Archives</b> and curated by <b>Jennifer VanerBurgh</b> (St. Mary's University) and <b>Carla Taunton</b> (NSCAD), and I collaborated with them to recreate it at the Archives of Ontario as a part of that year's Congress of the Social Sciences and Humanities at York University.

# üìê Design

A selection of promotional assets (posters, slides, social media content, etc.) that I have either directly designed or provided art direction for as a part of my time working as the Knowledge Mobilization Officer for the SSHRC Partnership Grant project <b>Archive/Counter-Archive</b>.<br/>
