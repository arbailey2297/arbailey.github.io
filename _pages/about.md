I am an interdisciplinary scholar, curator, and artist interested in the relationship between videogames, art, and history. 

I have a [PhD in Art History and Visual Culture](https://www.yorku.ca/gradstudies/ahvc/programs/phd/) from York University (Toronto), with a [dissertation focused on how videogames were produced, defined, and exhibited as art throughout the 2000s and 2010s](https://yorkspace.library.yorku.ca/items/e503fb54-acbd-4647-b9f1-199af6cb151d). 

I am currently a Mitacs Accelerate Postdoctoral Fellow with the SSHRC Partnership Grant Project ["Archive/Counter-Archive"](https://counterarchive.ca), where I research the knowledge mobilization utility of hybrid media platforms such as Manifold and VUCAVU in the context of Canadian short film and experimental cinema. As part of this postdoctoral work, I frequently engage in scholarly event coordination, curatorial programming, and grant writing.

This fall, I will start a SSHRC Postdoctoral Fellowship with the Technoculture, Art, and Games Centre at Concordia University with a project focused on producing pedagogically oriented digital archives of Canadian independent game development. 

I also work as a sessional instructor at OCAD University, McMaster University, and York University, teaching various courses related to game studies, critical archival studies, communications, film and media studies, and art history.
