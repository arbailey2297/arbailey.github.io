excerpt: 'The similarities  between P.T. and The Beginning Hour go beyond just the shift from third person combat to first person exploration. Hauntology and remediation are useful for conceptualizing the uncanny resemblance between The Beginning Hour and P.T.: both games are constrained experiences that take place within the tight confines of a locked house. Both games also force their players to move through domestic environments with no way to defend themselves from the malevolent entities lurking within, besides hiding or running away.'
