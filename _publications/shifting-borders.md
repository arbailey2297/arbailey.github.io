<b>Abstract:</b> This paper looks at how the walking simulator and artgame categories intersect, before comparatively analyzing two game designers whose work functions to disrupt the notions of genre these terms exemplify. The first work is Bill Viola‚Äôs <i>The Night Journey</i> (Game Innovation Lab & Viola, 2007), a gallery installation that many early game studies scholars used to help them first define how videogames could function as art. Following this, the paper compares Viola‚Äôs work to Connor Sherlock‚Äôs (2015) cheekily titled ‚ÄúWalking Simulator A Month Club.‚Äù With this project, Sherlock uses the itch.io and Patreon platforms to release a new experimental walking simulator game every month. Like The Night Journey, each of Sherlock‚Äôs games are ambiguously rendered and non-goal oriented. To conclude, this paper uses these two examples to investigate the potentially useful relations that can be uncovered between the experiences of traversing gallery and game space.

<b>Keywords:</b> walking simulators, art games, game art, Bill Viola, Connor Sherlock, game studies, game criticism, genre
